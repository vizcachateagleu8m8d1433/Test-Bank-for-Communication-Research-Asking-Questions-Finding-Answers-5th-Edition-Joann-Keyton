  * Communication Research: Asking Questions, Finding Answers covers basic research issues and processes, both quantitative and qualitative, appropriate for communication students with little or no previous research methods experience. The text's guiding principle is that methodological choices are made from one's research questions or hypotheses. This avoids the pitfall in which students learn one methodology or one methodological skill and then force that method to answer all types of questions. Instead of working with one methodology to answer all types of questions, students come away understanding a variety of methods and how to apply them appropriately.
 
  * Instructors and students can now access their course content through the Connect digital learning platform by purchasing either standalone Connect access or a bundle of print and Connect access. McGraw-Hill Connect® is a subscription-based learning service accessible online through your personal computer or tablet. Choose this option if your instructor will require Connect to be used in the course. Your subscription to Connect includes the following:
  * * SmartBook® - an adaptive digital version of the course textbook that personalizes your reading experience based on how well you are learning the content.
    * * Access to your instructor’s homework assignments, quizzes, syllabus, notes, reminders, and other important files for the course.
      * * Progress dashboards that quickly show how you are performing on your assignments and tips for improvement.
        * * The option to purchase (for a small fee) a print version of the book. This binder-ready, loose-leaf version includes free shipping.
